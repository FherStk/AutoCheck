# AutoCheck
Multi purpose and extensible automated assignment validator, designed for academic purposes only, which has been developed usign C# over .NET 6.0.
It has been created in order to automatically check the correctness of a set of students assignments including a score suggestion, but manual supervision is still needed.

Feel free to use, copy, fork or modify this code; but please refer a mention to this project and its author respecting also the licenses of the included third party software.

## How does it works?
AutoCheck can run any terminal command (local or remote) and also a set of predefined methods included in its own connectors; additionally a set of commands can be enveloped within a question, where any of those can be scored to compute a global assignment.

**WARNING: still in an early development stage.**
