# AutoCheck
Multi purpose and extensible automated assignment validator, designed for academic purposes only, developed in C# over .NET 5.0.
Is has been created in order to automatically check the correctness of a set of students assignments and to suggest a score, but manual supervision is still needed.

## How does it works?
AutoCheck can run any terminal command (local or remote) and also a set of predefined methods within its connectors, also a set of commands can be enveloped within a question where any question can be scored to compute a global assignement.
